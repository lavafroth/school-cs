Java programs for school assignments and projects.
Neither is all code here production ready, nor was it meant to be.
It's more like a collection of already solved questions in case you
wanna doze off during that boring CS lecture. ðŸ˜‰

## Quickstart
Within the desired subdirectory directory, execute

```bash
javac *.java
java Test
```

## TODO:
- [x] Make the code more readable / structured
- [ ] Add outputs for undergrad project
- [ ] Add test classes for all 11th grade programs
